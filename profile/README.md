# Mujin Notebook

**Mujin Notebook** is an independent, open-source workspace focused on:

* lightweight machine learning systems
* multilingual / Marathi NLP tools
* local AI pipelines (RAG, embeddings, inference)

This organization contains experiments, utilities, and small research-driven projects built for learning, exploration, and practical use.
